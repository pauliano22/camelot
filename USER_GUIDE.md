4. Use map to see geographical distribution

### Example 2: Investigating Specific Event
1. Click "SEARCH" to open filter panel
2. Select event type you're looking for (e.g., "Person")
3. Optionally select specific cameras
4. Click "INTEL" to see filtered results
5. Click entity on map for full details

### Example 3: Reviewing Timeline

## Tips & Best Practices

1. **Use Search Before Investigating**: Set filters first, then view intel feed
2. **Group Timeline by Camera**: Useful for seeing which cameras are most active
3. **3D View**: Best for understanding terrain and building layouts
4. **Satellite View**: Useful for aerial perspective
5. **Entity Details**: Click entities to track their full history
6. **Confidence Filter**: Set to 70%+ to reduce false positives
7. **Time Range**: Use "Last Hour" for recent activity focus

## Performance Notes

- System auto-refreshes data every 2-5 seconds
- Map entities update in real-time
- Filtering happens client-side (instant)
- Large datasets (100+ events) may slow scrolling slightly

## Troubleshooting

**Map not loading?**
- Check Mapbox token in frontend/.env
- Refresh page (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + R)

**No entities showing?**
- Check that cameras are online (CAMERAS panel)
- Verify simulator is running (check backend logs)
- Wait 5-10 seconds for entities to generate

**Search not working?**
- Make sure filters are set in SEARCH panel
- Then click "INTEL" button to see filtered results
- Check that events exist matching your filters

**Panel won't open?**
- Only one panel per side can be open
- Click button again to close/reopen
- Refresh browser if stuck

#### Collapsible Groups
**How it works:**
- Each group (time period or camera) can be expanded or collapsed
- Click the group header to toggle
- Shows event count badge
- Arrow icon indicates state:
  - ‚ñ∂ = Collapsed
  - ‚ñº = Expanded

**Expand/Collapse All:**
- Button at top of timeline
- Click to expand all groups at once
- Click again to collapse all groups
- Saves scrolling time when reviewing many events

**Benefits:**
- Less scrolling needed
- See overview of all groups at once
- Focus on specific time periods or cameras
- Faster navigation through large event lists

**Example Usage:**
1. Click "TIMELINE" button
2. Click "CAMERA" to group by camera
3. See all camera groups collapsed
4. Click specific camera to see its events
5. Or click "EXPAND ALL" to see everything

### Timeline Grouping Details

**Group by TIME:**
Groups events into meaningful time buckets:
- **Just Now**: Events from the last minute
- **Last 5 Minutes**: Events from 1-5 minutes ago
- **Last 15 Minutes**: Events from 5-15 minutes ago
- **Last 30 Minutes**: Events from 15-30 minutes ago
- **Last Hour**: Events from 30-60 minutes ago
- **[Hour]:00**: Older events grouped by hour (e.g., "18:00", "17:00")

This makes it easy to see recent activity at a glance without too many groups.

**Group by CAMERA:**
Groups all events by which camera detected them:
- **CAMERA 001**: All events from camera ID 1
- **CAMERA 002**: All events from camera ID 2
- etc.

Useful for tracking which cameras are most active or investigating a specific camera's activity.
